            The <span class = "bolded_black"> <a href = "https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/australian-road-deaths-database" > Australian Road Deaths Datbase (ARDD) </a>  </span> provide basic detail of road transport  crash fatalities in Australia as reported  
            by the police each month to the State and Territory road safety authorities. This website aims to generate several visualisations
            to delve into and perform a more insightful analysis on the number of crashes and fatalities in different States of Australia in the
            last 5 years - from Jan 2018 to July 2023. Through out the 5 year period from Jan 2018 to July 2023, Australia has recorded a total of 
            <span class = "bolded_blue"> 5978 </span>fatal crashes nationwide, which results in a total of 
            <span class = "bolded_blue"> 6457 </span> fatalities. Out of that approximately 3/4 of them are male which is over three times as much as that of female
            (4805 and 1640 respectively) with 12 fatalities where the gender was unknown.

            While the current total sex ratio of the total population is 0.994 (meaning there are 994 males per 1000 females). The yearly road crash 
            fatalities suggest that the total number of road fatalities for male has been consitently higher than that of female for the past 5 years.
            Such trend is showcased by this area line chart which depicts the number of road crashes fatalities categorised by Gender from Jan 2018 to July 2023            
            This line chart has a hover line with annotated tooltips to help reader better understand the visualisation.

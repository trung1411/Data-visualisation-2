            While the current total sex ratio of the total population is 0.994 (meaning there are 994 males per 1000 females). The yearly road crash 
            fatalities suggest that the total number of road fatalities for male has been consitently higher than that of female for the past 5 years.
            Such trend is showcased by this area line chart which depicts the number of road crashes fatalities categorised by Gender from Jan 2018 to July 2023
